This project revolves around the construction of a crop prediction model utilizing logistic regression 
an
d environmental data. The dataset encompasses information on temperature, humidity, and 
precipitation, among other factors, relevant to various crops. Through numerical labeling of crop types, 
the logistic regression model is trained on a divided dataset, distinguishing between training and testing 
sets. The preprocessing stage involves mapping categorical crop labels to numerical values, facilitating 
effective model training. Data visualization, conducted using Seaborn, provides insights into crop 
distribution concerning temperature. The logistic regression model is subsequently trained on the 
training set and evaluated through cross-validation on the testing set. Performance metrics such as 
confusion matrix, F1 score, recall, precision, and accuracy gauge the model's predictive prowess. 
Additionally, a Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve is generated to illustrate the trade-off 
between true positive and false positive rates. The trained logistic regression model is saved for future 
use and exemplifies a specific prediction using new environmental data. This project lays the 
groundwork for machine learning models in crop classification, potentially benefiting precision 
agriculture and assisting farmers in decision-making processes
